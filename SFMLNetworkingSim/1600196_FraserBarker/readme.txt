//-- Application Controls --//

When the application is started, an sfml window and console will appear.

The console will prompt you to either press '1' to be a server or '2' to be a client.

During the simulation, pressing 'W' will increase the boids separation value, whereas 'S' will decrease it.

Clicking the left mouse button within the window will place an obstacle at that location.

Boids will tend to avoid the location of obstacles.
